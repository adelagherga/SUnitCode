INPUT:
    B:= [b_1,...,b_n], a matrix over ZZ with columns b_i,
        {b_1,...,b_n} form a basis of a lattice, L
    C:= a constant > 0 
    Bound:= a constant > 0 determining the maximum number of short vectors to be computed

OUTPUT:
    if #z > Bound:
        maxReached:= "true", indicates that the number of short vector solutions is larger than Bound; 
        M:= associated lattice matrix such that y_i:= Transpose(M*Transpose(x_i)) is a vector if the lattice with norm <= C, where
            x_i:= a lattice coefficient vector
        z:= the incomplete set of lattice coefficient vectors x_i of the lattice L such that y_i:= Transpose(M*Transpose(x_i)) has norm <= C,
            ie. Q(y_i) <= C, where Q is the binary quadratic form Q associated to the lattice L
            Equivalently, (y_i)*A*Transpose(y_i) = [z_i], where z_i <= C
    
    if #z <= Bound:
        maxReached:= "false", indicates that the number of short vector solutions is smaller than Bound; 
        M:= associated lattice matrix such that y_i:= Transpose(M*Transpose(x_i)) is a vector if the lattice with norm <= C, where
            x_i:= a lattice coefficient vector
        z:= the set of all lattice coefficient vectors x_i of the lattice L such that y_i:= Transpose(M*Transpose(x_i)) has norm <= C,
            ie. Q(y_i) <= C, where Q is the binary quadratic form Q associated to the lattice L
            Equivalently, (y_i)*A*Transpose(y_i) = [z_i], where z_i <= C

COMMENTS:
    There are 2*(#z) total such vectors, including multiplication by a sign
